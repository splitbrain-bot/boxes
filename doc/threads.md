# Threads

A thread is one conversation with an agent in a box. All threads of a [box](boxes.md) share the same container,
workspace, and network. Two threads of one box can use different agents, so Claude and Codex can work on the same
checkout.


## Opening a thread

Select a thread on a box card. Each browser tab connects to one thread, so two tabs can follow two threads of the same
box.

Opening a thread of a stopped box starts the container and the [adapter](acp.md) of the thread's agent. The connection
dot in the header shows the state: connecting, connected, reconnecting, or disconnected.

Closing the tab does not stop the agent's turn. The orchestrator holds the connection to the adapter, so a turn runs to
its end with nobody watching. Opening the thread again shows everything that was said since.

## Starting a new thread

Select **New thread** on a box card. The dialog asks for the agent, its mode, and its other settings, because the agent
is fixed for the life of the thread. The dialog shows the settings that the agent's adapter last advertised, and the
last choice made for that agent.

A new thread starts empty, on the same workspace as the other threads of the box.

## Thread names

An agent can give its thread a title at the end of a turn. Until it does, the first line of a prompt sent on the thread
names it. A thread that was never prompted shows as "Thread" and its number, for example "Thread 2".

## Sending prompts

Type the prompt in the text area at the bottom and send it with Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on a Mac) or the **Send message**
button. Enter adds a line, because a prompt is often several lines of prose.

To attach a file, select the **Add Attachment** button beside the text area, or drop the file onto it. Attached files
are uploaded to the box's workspace when the prompt is sent; the agent receives their paths with the prompt.

While the agent works, a stop button replaces the send button. It cancels the turn. A command the turn left running in
the background is not cancelled by this; see "Background work" below.

### Slash commands

Type `/` at the start of the text area to list the slash commands the agent's adapter accepts. The list filters as you
type. Picking a command writes it into the text area without sending, because a command can take arguments.

Skills and commands are configured in [agent sets](agent-sets.md), not per thread.

### Modes and settings

The **Agent settings** button in the thread header opens the settings the adapter offers: the agent mode, the model, and
whatever else it advertises, such as a thinking effort.

The mode controls how much the agent does without asking, for example the plan mode of Claude Code or the read-only mode
of Codex. Changes apply to the open thread at once. The orchestrator records the mode and settings, so a restarted
adapter puts the thread back the way it was.

## Permission requests

Some tool calls need a decision. The question renders on the tool call that caused it, and the turn waits for an answer.
All browsers on the thread show the question; the first answer removes it from the others. When nobody watches the
thread, the orchestrator can send a push notification. See [notifications](notifications.md).

## Marking a thread done

Select the **Mark this thread done** button in the thread header to mark the thread done. The box list strikes the
thread's name through. The mark is a note for the reader only: the thread keeps its conversation, its background work
keeps running, and it still answers prompts. Select the button again to remove the mark.

## Forking a thread

Select the **Fork this thread** button in the thread header to branch the conversation into a second thread. The fork
opens on everything said in the source thread so far and continues on its own from there. The source thread is not
changed.

A fork keeps the agent and the settings of its source, because only the adapter that wrote a transcript can load it. It
starts in its agent's fork mode — plan for Claude Code, read-only for Codex — because it shares the source's workspace
while the source can still be working in it.

The fork button shows only when the adapter has advertised the fork capability. A thread that was never prompted has
nothing to fork yet.

After forking, the page shows a link to the new thread. Open it in a new tab to keep both conversations on screen.

## Background work

An agent can leave work running in the box after its turn: a dev server, a build, a monitor. While something runs, a bar
above the text area lists the tasks of this thread with their ages. Expand it to see each task. Select a stop button to
kill one task, or **Stop all** to kill all of them. Killing stops the process and everything it started; half-done work
stays half-done.

Work that no adapter claims any more — for example after an adapter restart — shows as a badge on the box card instead.
**Stop everything** on the card kills every process in the box that Boxes did not start itself.

## Reading state at a glance

The row of a thread on the box card shows a status dot: approval waiting, the agent thinking, background work running,
or idle. The browser tab title carries the same state as a symbol, so a thread that needs a person is visible in the tab
bar. In the thread header, the box name comes first and the thread name after it, as in the tab title.

## History

The orchestrator keeps each thread's messages in memory, up to 4 MiB per thread. Above that, it drops the oldest
messages, and the top of the thread shows **Load full history**. The button asks the adapter to replay the full
transcript. It is refused while the agent is working on the thread.

## Technical internals

### The record of a thread

The orchestrator, not the adapter, is the source of truth for which threads exist: `session/list` returns only threads
that have a transcript on disk, and a thread created but never prompted has none. The `threads` table records what the
adapter forgets — which harness runs the thread, the adapter's session id, the mode and the config map — plus the
bookkeeping: a per-box ordinal that is never reused, the title, the `done` mark, and for a fork the source thread.

The mode has its own column, and the config map skips every option of category `mode`. Both adapters also report the
mode as a config option, and two mechanisms that set the same value can disagree.

### Turn state

ACP has no "turn finished" signal, so the gateway infers it in `gateway/activity.ts`. The Claude adapter ends a
processing cycle with a `usage_update` that carries a cost, which serves as the end marker; the Codex adapter sends
none, so the fallback is silence — an update from the agent marks the thread as active, and `AGENT_QUIET_SECONDS`
without output and without an open foreground tool call marks the thread as stopped. The gateway sends the full state —
prompt open, agent active, background tasks — to every browser in a `_boxes/turn_state` notification.

### Background work

Both adapters implement the same async-task extension: `async_task_spawned` adds a task to the thread,
`async_task_state_update` with a terminal state removes it, and Claude Code's `async_task_progress` can rename one.
`gateway/background.ts` keeps one board per adapter connection, and an adapter exit removes the tasks it announced — a
restarted adapter has no record of what its predecessor started. The orchestrator sends the stop as
`_session/async_task/stop` on the thread's own connection.

For the same reason, the events cannot answer whether the box is busy: the orchestrator reads the container's process
table, and everything that is not the init, an adapter, an agent process or a known resident helper counts as work and
prevents the idle reaper from stopping the box. The box-level stop reads the table again from inside the container,
sends TERM to the deepest processes first, and sends KILL to what survives shortly after, without waiting.

### Forking

The adapter branches the conversation in full but writes no transcript for the fork until its first prompt. So the fork
starts with a copy of the source's thread log, and `inherits_from` records the source: a fork that was never prompted is
branched again after an adapter restart, and its log is copied again. The first prompt clears the column, because from
then on the fork has a transcript of its own to load.
